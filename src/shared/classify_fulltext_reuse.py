classify_fulltext_reuse.py - Classify data reuse from a paper's full text.

The citation-context pipeline extracts small windows of text around each
citation and asks the model to judge from those. This module takes the opposite
approach: it hands the model the entire paper and asks it to find the evidence
itself, then requires it to quote the passage it judged from.

Requiring a quote is the point. A label on its own cannot be checked, whereas a
quote either appears in the paper or it does not, and a quote that does not
appear is a fabrication the caller can detect and act on.

Two rules govern the output:

  1. A failure is never a classification. Any transport error, malformed
     response, or unrecognized label produces ERROR. It never produces REUSE,
     and it never produces a quiet MENTION that would read as a real judgement.

  2. Every quote is checked against the paper text before it is returned.

Requires DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in the environment or in the project .env file.

PRIMARY reads like: "data are available at [identifier]", "we deposited", "our recordings have been made available". The paper will describe performing the experiments that produced the data.

REUSE reads like: "data were downloaded from", "we analyzed the publicly available dataset", "obtained from the X archive", "we used the dataset of [author]".

A paper can be PRIMARY for its own deposit while also reusing other datasets; judge only the identifier named above. A review or commentary that merely lists the identifier is NEITHER, not REUSE."""

IF AND ONLY IF THE CLASSIFICATION IS REUSE, ALSO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING
For every other classification, set same_lab, same_lab_confidence, source_archive and reused_modalities to null.

SAME LAB OR A DIFFERENT ONE?
Compare the author list of this paper against the authors of the work whose data was reused. Set same_lab to true when the same group is reusing or extending its own data, and false when a different group is using someone else's. Judge this only from author overlap and statements like "our previously published dataset" or "data we collected in [citation]". Shared authorship is NOT itself evidence of reuse: decide the classification first, from the text, and answer this separately. Give same_lab_confidence from 1 to 10.

WHICH ARCHIVE SUPPLIED THE DATA?
Name where the data was actually obtained, using one of these names exactly when it applies:
{archive_list}
Use the name of another repository if the paper names one that is not on this list. Use "unclear" if the paper does not say where the data came from. Do not guess from the subject matter: name an archive only if the paper mentions it.

WHICH PART OF THE DATA WAS REUSED? — THE DECISIVE QUESTION FOR THIS STUDY
Many neuroscience datasets are multimodal, and their components are hosted in different places. Patch-seq studies in particular pair electrophysiological recordings with reconstructed cell morphology and with transcriptomics. The recordings and the behavior recorded alongside them live in the neurophysiology archive; morphological reconstructions live in NeuroMorpho, the Allen Cell Types Database, or the Brain Image Library; gene expression lives on GEO, CELLxGENE, or NeMO.

Identify which parts THIS paper actually obtained and analyzed, as a list from:
  - neurophysiology: recordings of neural activity. Intracellular or extracellular electrophysiology, patch-clamp traces, spike trains, firing rates, membrane or intrinsic properties, LFP, EEG, ECoG, or calcium/voltage imaging of activity.
  - behavior: behavioral, task, or positional data recorded alongside the neural data.
  - morphology: reconstructed cell shape, dendritic or axonal structure, anatomical reconstructions.
  - transcriptomics: gene expression, RNA-seq counts, transcriptomic cell-type labels or clusters.
  - other: anything else obtained that none of the above covers.
  - unclear: the paper does not say which part it used.

Judge this from what the paper says it analyzed, NOT from what the cited dataset contains. This is the most common error to avoid: a paper that cites a Patch-seq study but analyzes only its gene expression or only its reconstructions has reused transcriptomics or morphology alone. Do not list neurophysiology merely because the original study also recorded it. List neurophysiology only when the text shows this paper handled the recordings themselves.

QUOTE THE PROVENANCE SEPARATELY
Alongside the reuse evidence, quote the passage(s) that establish WHERE the data came from: the archive name, an accession or dataset identifier, a DOI, a URL, or a data availability statement. These go in source_quotes and are subject to the same character-for-character rule. If the paper never says where the data came from, return an empty list rather than inferring it.

EVIDENCE QUOTES — THIS IS THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
You MUST quote the exact passage(s) from the paper that drove your judgement.
- Copy the text CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER from the paper above. Do not paraphrase, summarize, correct, abridge, or join separated sentences.
- Each quote should be one or two complete sentences: long enough to stand on its own, short enough to be precise.
- Give 1 to 3 quotes. {quote_guidance}
- If you cannot find a supporting passage, return an empty list rather than inventing one. A fabricated quote is far worse than no quote.
